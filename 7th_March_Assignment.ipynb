Covariance measures whether a variation in one variable results in a variation in another variable; for example, looking at whether an increase in one variable results in an increase, decrease, or no change in the other variable. Correlation measures the direction as well as the strength of the relationship between two variables (i.e. how strongly these two variables are related to each other).                                                             \n",

    "Value range: Although both correlation coefficient and covariance are measures of linear association, correlation coefficients are standardized, therefore displaying an absolute value within a definite range from -1 to 1.
